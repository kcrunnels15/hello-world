# hello-world
small pet projects repository

So far, this is just a dumping spot for any pet ideas.
Currently, I am thinking about a Linux CLI Java editor, like nano, or mcedit, but with templates.

# System God
The .cmd files are to be placed in the same Windows directory, and used for connecting to the internet or creating files/folders quickly. 
internetgod.cmd doesn't work very well, I built it for connecting to my home network, and the network detecting bit won't connect your computer. 
I recomend modifying the crap out of this.
